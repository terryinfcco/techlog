**Thoughts for today**

Couple of things I want to add for today. I want to add my mkdocs stuff to the terryinfcco.com website. Either by putting on the hostinger vps or by putting it on github and linking to it.

Also I want to settle on a blogging platform. I’m actually seriously considering laying out what I want the blog to look like and then writing HTML and CSS templates to make that happen.

Finally I’m thinking about installing a LTS vanilla ubuntu and running QEMU/KVM stuff under it that I work with regularly. That way I think I can do snapshots and be safe while working with newer software. Just something I’m thinking about.
