**January 10**

Jesus, I went crazy today.

* I bought one month of vps service from hostinger, and 3 years of the domain terryinfcco.com
* So far all that's on it is this TiddlyWiki
* I'm still waiting for the ssl certificate to activate
* OK I bought and set up a second vps service this one for 4 years. I'll just let the first one expire. IP of this one is 93.188.162.134

So I think the only thing left on the beelink server is Syncthing. Not sure I care about that. I think Dropbox is safer and now that I'm not using any raspberry pi as desktops that's probably the way to go.

Tomorrow I should work on backup scripts for dokuwiki and tiddlywiki like the daily ones I have for the beelink server.
