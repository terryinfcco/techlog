**Dave Gray Videos and Odin Project**

I also like the stuff Dave Gray does on YouTube. Particularly that he uses the semantic tags like header, section, etc. So I'm going to work on that. And I read on Reddit that there's a really good free Web Developer learning course called The Odin Project and I want to look at that.
