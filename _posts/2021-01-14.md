**MkDocs as a Journal Platform**

Is there any reason this (MkDocs) can't work as well for a journal as any other platform? I really like the material theme. I don't know if I can do deeper nesting and I'm not sure I want to. Would that have issues around sorting? Also MkDocs is easy to search. I think that's a big plus.

Had a lot of trouble sorting posts. Not what I wanted.
