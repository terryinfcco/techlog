**January 9**

* Working on setting up a TiddlyWiki nodejs instance on the Beelink server. So far so good. I'm able to create tiddlers and save them. I've also adapted the backup scripts I used for Dokuwiki to backup TiddlyWiki.
* The other thing I want to do today is make a clonezilla backup of my Arch Linux I3 install because I'm really happy with it right now. Done.
