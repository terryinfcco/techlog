**Raspberry Pi 4 Server Progress**

* Got openmediavault and syncthing both working on the Raspberry Pi 4. Copied the music folder to openmediavault and was able to point to that with the Sonos system. 
* Tried to install dokuwiki on the Pi 4 and failed. It's nginx rather than apache2 and I have no idea how to make it work. I started to follow some online instructions but they completely failed. 
* I'm thinking that the best thing I can do is to backup the dokuwiki data files (thank goodness they're plain text - glad I did that) and then over time integrate them into both Jekyll and Mkdocs. 
* OK dokuwiki is backed up into the Thursday folder of the dropbox dokuwiki backups.
