**Fitting it all together**

* Right now I feel really good about what I've got going with Mkdocs and the gtpkb installation.
* I'd like to get that same feeling about Jekyll. My goal is to do documentation in Mkdocs and a blog of sorts in Jekyll.
* I think my idea of taking notes on paper, then when I've got several sheets created, scan them, upload the png or jpg files to google drive, and then open them in Google Docs. That automatically does an ocr and I've got a text file I can copy into a markdown editor and put into Mkdocs.
  
### OpenMediaVault on Raspbery Pi 4

* Every time I decide I'm going to use the pi4 to do development something doesn't work. Today it was youtube playback and then no sound when trying to stream through vlc. 
* So I'm now installing openmediavault on the Raspberry Pi 4 (I did keep the old system if I decide to revert) and the plan is that once it's up and running or at least backed up that the beelink can come upstairs and be my low power development machine.
