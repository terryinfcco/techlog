**Coder Dojo Build Your Own WebSite**

I've spent some of the morning going through the above book, creating the code, and documenting what I've learned in Tiddlywiki. It's going pretty well. 

The part I've been doing is mostly CSS and I've been adding a line of CSS at a time to my stylesheet, being careful to watch what happens when I refresh the webpage, and then documenting what I saw happen. This doesn't document every possible option for every CSS command, but it gives me a place to start and if I want more info that's what the web is for.
