**Working on Jekyll**

  * Found another video series on jekyll - this one by a guy named Thomas Bradley. He goes through collections, data and pages, all of which are important to me.
  * And once I get more organized, I want to be able to include these notes in a file that's easier to find but for now, I'm going to make a couple of lists. One is going to be tools I'm using - that way since I like distro hopping so much I can have a list that's better than the general one that's in my head. The other is a list of what I need to do to make changes to my jekyll github website. 
  
### Tools 

  * Git
  * Markdown editor - right now using Ghostwriter
  * Syncthing
  
### Adding to Jekyll

  * Create new content - right now all I know how to do is posts.
  * git status to make sure it's what I expect.
  * git add *
  * git commit -m "Describe what you did"
  * git push origin master
