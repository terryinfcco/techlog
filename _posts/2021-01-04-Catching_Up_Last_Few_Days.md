**Beelink, Pi4 and Coder Dojo**

Not sure where I left off, but I've put OpenMediaVault on the Raspberry Pi 4, Apache and Dokuwiki on the Beelink. I've ordered a new ethernet switch and 
plan to put those devices and the switch in the basement tomorrow.

I did work on the first of the coder dojo books today and got through about 20 pages. The idea of only writing down concepts and leaving syntax to be looked up
definitely appeals to me.
